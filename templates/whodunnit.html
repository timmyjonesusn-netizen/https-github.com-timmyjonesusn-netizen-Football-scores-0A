  <h2>Whodunnit: The Purple Lights</h2>
  <div class="story-box">
    <p>
      Ragland slept under a violet haze that night, the mill’s river mist tinted by neon from a new sign that no one
      remembered approving. At 2:17 a.m., the lights flickered, the sign pulsed once, and the town fountain stopped.
      By sunrise, three folks had the same tale: a quiet hum like a distant transformer… and bubbles drifting across
      downtown like they had weight.

      Sheriff Lane walked the square, boots tapping brick, eyes on the windows. There was no spray paint, no footprints,
      only a smear of burgundy shimmer along the fountain’s brass lip. The diner clock read the wrong time—exactly
      one hour ahead—though no one touched it. Lane checked the security cam. The footage showed the square empty,
      except for one dancing silhouette sliding left to right, arms swinging like a metronome. At the top of the hour,
      the figure tipped a hat to the camera and vanished.

      The clue wasn’t the figure. It was the timing. Every clock that failed had been set by a single phone the
      night before. Only one person in town had that habit: the handyman who synchronized school bells, parade starters,
      and the scoreboard at Purple Devils Stadium. Lane knew where to look. The answer wasn’t in the wires—it was in
      the schedule.

      Who did it? The one who controls the time.
